# RL Gym Testing
 A collection of my attempts at solving different OpenAI Gym environments.

## How to Use
 Models can be chosen by running "main.py" and calling the desired model.
 You can choose to train the mode by using -t, or test the model by excluding that parameter.

 Ex: `python main.py Pendulum -t`

 ## Models
 - Pendulum

 # Pre-requisites 
 Before running the model, you'll need to install the required packages. 
 You can do by running the following command in the main directory:
 `pip install -r requirements.txt`
